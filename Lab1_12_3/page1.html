        <li> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</li>
        <li> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took
            a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        </li>
        <li> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
            essentially unchanged.
        </li>
        <li> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
            more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
